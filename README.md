# Hackerrank Solutions

A collection of folders containing some of my submissions to hackerrank.com. All written in Python3. 

## What's in here

Each folder contains these files:

1. Problem_Description - contains the URL to the problem on hackerrank.com, and the command-line to use for running/testing the code locally (CLI syntax suitable for MacOS and Linux)
2. *.py - the python script containing my submission
3. other files - sample inputs, and possibly working & output files

## Have a go!

If you enjoy some bite-sized coding challenges, sign-up at hackerrank.com and begin! Many languages to choose from (although no Dart...). For me, I found Python3 was a good fit for the type of problems presented. Each challenge typically involve:

1. Comprehension - understand the problem statement, what they're asking for
2. Math - breakdown the calculations involved and look for patterns, 
3. Coding - write, test and validate the solution with the sample inputs given
4. Submit - paste your code into the in-browser editor and let it rip against the full set of inputs
5. Rinse & repeat the above until you get it solved
